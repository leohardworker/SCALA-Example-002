# SCALA-Example-002
Scala example that processes data obtained from fluid mechanics
This example creates a data class named FluidMechanicsData. The FluidMechanicsAnalyzer object contains a method that analyzes fluid mechanics data. It evaluates the fluid motion, turbulence and pressure state based on data such as flow rate, pressure and viscosity.

You can save this example in a local file (for example, you can name it FluidMechanicsAnalyzer.scala), compile and run it with the Scala compiler. In this example, the FluidMechanicsData class represents the data structure, while the FluidMechanicsAnalyzer object contains the method that analyzes the data.
